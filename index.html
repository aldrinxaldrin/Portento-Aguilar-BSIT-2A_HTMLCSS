            <p>Marinduque National High School or most commonly known as MNHS, is a public secondary school founded in 1914 located in Boac, Marinduque, in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Marinduque National High School is formerly known as Marinduque Provincial High School, recognized as the first secondary school in the Province. It was established in the year 1914 by Municipal president Vicente Lardizabal Trivino, and served as the home of the Boac Boy Scout Trailers, one of the pioneer scouting units in the country organized on July 10, 1922, by Tenderfoot Scout Celso M. Mirafuente.</p>
            <p>Parliamentary Bill No. 1328 on Marinduque Provincial High School's nationalization was signed into law, November 13, 1982, as Batas Pambansa Bilang 267. The school adopted its new name, Marinduque National High School (MNHS), in August 1984 when the first cash disbursement BCDC was released by the national government.</p>

                    <p>The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863 as the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction under a Chairman. The Education agency underwent many reorganization efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the changing administrations and charters. The present day Department of Education was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes the mandate of this agency.</p><br>
                    <p>The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and coordinates policies, plans, programs and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal basic education. It supervises all elementary and secondary education institutions, including alternative learning systems, both public and private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete, adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.</p>
